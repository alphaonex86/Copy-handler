If you encounter a problem with the program that may be a result of a programming error you may write to <a href="mailto:support@copyhandler.com">support@copyhandler.com</a> or <a href="mailto:copyhandler@o2.pl">copyhandler@o2.pl</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>All of the bug reports are welcome, but before you write:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>make sure you have the latest version of the program. You can download it from <a href="http://www.copyhandler.com" target="_blank">the web page</a>.</li>
<li>[concerning only the zip version] make sure you have properly replaced the shell extension dll. Most of the errors comes from using old dll with a new program. If you have used the previous version of program - unregister shell extension dll, restart the computer, delete the old shell extension dll, copy the new one into that place and register the extension in the program's menu. See also the <a href="installation.htm">installation/deinstallation procedure</a>.</li>
</ul>

<b>What the mail should contain (not all is required, but everything may be helpful) ?</b>
<ul>
<li>The detailed bug description (what happened, how can I reproduce the error). This is required; if I do not know how to reproduce the error how can I fix it ?</li>
<li>The configuration file of the Copy Handler (copy handler.ini) if the error could be related to the options set. If you are not sure - include compressed (zip or rar archives preferred) configuration file in the mail. Not required, but in some cases may be helpful.</li>
<li>The system configuration (version of a Windows system, version of the Internet explorer installed in system, version of Copy Handler that you have used). Not required, but helpful - some problems appears only in specific systems.</li>
<li>The speed of the processor and count of RAM. Not required, but in some cases helpful.</li>
<li>Any other info (perhaps a screen shot) that may be helpful.</li>
</ul>

If you want to include any attachment with the mail - make sure it's in the small format (ie. for screenshots and images make sure they are in .jpg or .gif format. Absolutely do not send images in .bmp format). Any other attachment should be compressed by ZIP or RAR compressor.
