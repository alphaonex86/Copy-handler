<div class="text">
This dialog is displayed when the working thread finds that there is a file in the destination location that is smaller than the file being copied. The possible reasons are:
<ul>
<li>there is an older version of the file in the destination location; in that case you should recopy the file</li>
<li>there is a part of the file being copied in the destination location; the file were not copied to the end; you should copy rest the file</li>
</ul>
<br>
Possible operations:
<ul>
<li><b>Copy rest</b> - copies the rest of a file.</li>
<li><b>Copy rest all</b> - as above, but does the 'Copy rest' for all subsequent situations, where the destination file is smaller than the source one.</li>
<li><b>Recopy</b> - recopies the whole file from the beginning</li>
<li><b>Recopy all</b> - like the above, but does the 'Recopy' for all subsequent situations, where the destination file is smaller than the source one.</li>
<li><b>Ignore</b> - ignores this info, and skips the file.</li>
<li><b>Ignore all</b> - like the above button, but also ignores the next infos of this type.</li>
<li><b>Cancel</b> - cancels the task.</li>
</ul>
