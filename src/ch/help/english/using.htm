<b>How to copy something using Copy Handler ?</b><br>
If you have registered shell extension DLL:<br>
<ul>
<li>Drag some files/folder in explorer by right mouse button, drop it somewhere else and choose one of the options from context menu that begins with (CH)</li>
<li>Copy something to clipboard (by selecting some files in explorer and pressing ctrl+C on your keyboard or by choosing 'Copy' command from explorer context menu) and paste it in other location by '(CH) Paste' or '(CH) Paste special...'. If you have turned on the option 'Monitor clipboard' - after the copying something into the clipboard there should be displayed a dialog where you can choose the destination location for the selected files and folders and the type of operation.</li>
<li>If you have selected option 'Intercept dragging' and you have rather new system (Windows Me, 2000 or XP) you can also drag&drop files by left mouse button and use standard Windows 'Paste' command or ctrl+V.</li>
</ul>

If you haven't registered the shell extension:<br>
<ul>
<li>The only way to start copying or moving data is to select 'Enter custom copy parameters...' from program's menu, to fill it with needed data (source files and destination folder) and to accept the entered data with OK button.</li>
</ul>
